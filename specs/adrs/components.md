* Deciders: Everyone
* Date:  5/20/2021

## Context and Problem Statement

Figuring out the best way to code on the same file with the least amount of conflicts.


## Considered Options

* All Code on the same file
* Create seperate .js files that specify components
  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We decided to create js components

### [Option 1] All Code on the Same File

* Good, least amount of code
* Bad, because potentially a lot of conflicts
* 
### [option 2] Components

* Good, because simplifies our main html code
* Good, gives good environment for both front and back end to work in pairs
* Bad, because need to learn how to create these components
