# How to design the center element where information goes

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to figure out if our webapp would have 2 html.div's in the center to use as text areas or just 1.


## Considered Options

* 1 div
* 2 divs

Chosen option: 1 Overall Div for every log page; Only 1 day/week/month on the screen at once

We initially decided to choose 2 divs for most log pages to resemble a book. However with the time we have left, it seems that making the pages one div is much simpler on both HTMl/CSS and JS. With our custom components, it also add's complexity that we could not see.
