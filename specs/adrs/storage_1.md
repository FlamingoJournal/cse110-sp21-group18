## Context and Problem Statement

We were unsure of how to store user data. 


## Considered Options

* Local storage
* Server Storage

Chosen option: Local Storage, because it is simpler to implement, and lets us not worry about security. 

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Local Storage

* Good, because easy to implement
* Good, because access does not require internet 
* Bad, because need to be on specific device to access logs

### Server

* Good, because can access data from any device
* Bad, because internet is required
* Bad, because group would need to learn more about server storage
