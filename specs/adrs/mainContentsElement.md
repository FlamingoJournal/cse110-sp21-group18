# How to design the center element where information goes

* Status: depricated

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to figure out if our webapp would have 2 html.div's in the center to use as text areas or just 1.


## Considered Options

* 1 div
* 2 divs

Chosen option: 2 divs for everything but Future Log, 1 div for future log

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### 1 Div

* Good, less code
* Good, easier to fill with content
* Bad, because hard to display "2 page look" on 1 div

### 2 Div

* Good, because easy to show 2 days on one screen
* Bad, more code and complex logic
