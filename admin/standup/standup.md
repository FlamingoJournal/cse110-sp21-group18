# This data was exported from the GeekBot extension from Slack
Note: We started doing daily standups after Sprint 1 because we were recommended by a team to use the GeekBot Slack app. The reason we didn't do it earlier was because we were unable to coordinate a time to meet daily and we were unaware we could use bots to facilitate this process.
